# Skraper DAT to muOS TXT

This tool converts game description data from Skraper DAT files into TXT files compatible with muOS, making it easy to display game details in the muOS interface.

**1. Download Game Metadata:**  Use  [Skraper](skraper.net)  to download game descriptions for your ROMs. Optionally, adjust description settings in the METADATA tab if needed. If you need help with using Skraper, you may watch  [Retro Game Corps Video](https://youtu.be/g1sjR6IX9Eo?si=loOJREWHkQtJjOil&t=510). Already downloaded the game visuals before? You don't need this step, you most probably have .DAT files, you can skip to step 2.

**2. Select DAT Files:**  Check sdcard/ROMS path to see your system folders. Locate the DAT files saved by Skraper in each system folder (e.g., Nintendo 64.dat, Sega Game Gear.dat, PSP.dat). Drag and drop these files into the area below. You can select multiple files at once.

**3. Start Conversion:**  Click the process button to convert your files. Your game descriptions will be generated as TXT files, packaged in ZIP archives, ready for download in seconds.

**4. Transfer TXT Files:**  Extract the TXT files from the ZIP and move them to the appropriate muOS directory for each system: MUOS -> info -> catalogue -> [System Folder] -> text.

All Done! Press the Menu button in muOS to view your game descriptions!
